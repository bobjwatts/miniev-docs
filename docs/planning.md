## 1. Selecting the Mini Cooper

**Reasoning behind choosing a 2005 Mini Cooper S (R53):**

- Compact and lightweight chassis suitable for EV conversion.
- Sport-oriented suspension and responsive handling characteristics.
- S badge has better disk brakes and additional sway bars compared to standard Mini Cooper
- Robust aftermarket support and availability of OEM and custom parts.
- Well-documented electrical system, simplifying integration.
- Active enthusiast community offering resources and experience.
- Iconic and desirable design.

**Evaluation process:**

- Detailed 43-point mechanical inspection.
- VIN verification and vehicle history check.
- Structural integrity and rust assessment.
- Visual documentation (photos/videos) of initial vehicle condition.

## 2. Nissan Leaf as Donor Car

**Why Gen 2 Nissan Leaf?**

- Reliable electric drivetrain proven in real-world conditions.
- Availability of affordable salvage or used vehicles.
- Documented experiences and community knowledge available online.

**Components Required from Donor Car:**

- Electric motor, inverter, and gearbox assembly.
- Battery pack modules and battery management components.
- High-voltage charging system, DC-DC converter, and associated cabling.
- Drive by wire pedal
- Gear selector
- Ancillary components (cooling system components, electronic controls).

**Cost Estimation and Procurement Plan:**

- Estimated budget for Leaf components: AU$7,000–10,000.
- Preferred sourcing strategy through salvage yards and online EV communities.

## 3. Additional Components & Tools

**EV-Specific Components Needed:**

- Battery Management System (BMS) — Orion BMS or similar.
- OpenInverter system.
- CAN bus spoofing tools (ESP32-based setup for integration).

**Workshop and Safety Tools:**

- General mechanic's toolkit with insulated spanners and wrenches.
- Diagnostic equipment: multimeter, pole meter, OBD2 scan tool.
- Safety equipment and PPE including HV-rated gloves, insulated footwear, fire-resistant clothing, safety glasses.
