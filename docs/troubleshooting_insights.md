## Common Issues & Fixes

### üö´ Inverter Not Responding
**Symptom:** No motor movement during bench test  
**Diagnosis:** Incorrect pre-charge timing; contactor not closing  
**Solution:** Adjust OpenInverter settings and verify correct pre-charge resistor value

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BMS Reporting Fault Codes
**Symptom:** Orion BMS displays cell imbalance error  
**Diagnosis:** One Leaf module had lower voltage  
**Solution:** Manually top-balanced module before integration

---

### üå° Cabin Heater Tripping Fuse
**Symptom:** Heater cuts out after 5‚Äì10 seconds  
**Diagnosis:** Undersized fuse for startup current  
**Solution:** Upgraded to correct rated fuse per heater spec sheet

---

## Technical Notes

- OpenInverter throttle configuration used **dual analog Leaf pedal**
- CAN spoofing uses **ESP32 with MCP2515**, mapped Mini RPM, speed, SOC
- 12V system fused into existing Mini power distribution
- Chrono Pack repurposed: coolant temp gauge shows inverter temp; fuel gauge shows SOC

## Lessons Learned

- Confirm all donor components on the bench *before* disassembling the car
- Take photos and label everything during disassembly
- CAN reverse-engineering is easier if you simulate road conditions (e.g. moving wheels on jacks)
- Pre-charge logic must be tested under load
