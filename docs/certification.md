# Certification & Compliance

This section outlines the steps taken to ensure the EV conversion complies with Australian Design Rules (ADRs), Vehicle Assessment Signatory Scheme (VASS) requirements, and general road safety and engineering standards. It includes documentation of safety procedures, component selection, and professional practices aligned with national EV conversion expectations.

---

## Objectives

- Ensure full compliance with all relevant ADRs and EV-specific modifications under VASS guidelines.
- Maintain documented safety practices throughout the build.
- Collaborate effectively with a certified VASS engineer to streamline inspection and certification.
- Provide clear evidence of professional standards, component traceability, and vehicle integrity.

---

## Certification Pathway (Victoria, Australia)

1. **Initial Consultation with VASS Engineer**
   - Discuss project scope and compliance approach.
   - Present component list and intended installation plans.

2. **Compliance Areas Covered**
   - HV system safety and isolation
   - Mechanical integration (mounts, structural modifications)
   - Battery installation and restraint
   - Electrical safety (fusing, wiring, DC-DC, charger)
   - Regenerative braking (if applicable)
   - Weight distribution and axle loads
   - Functional systems: lights, indicators, HVAC, demister

3. **Inspection Stages**
   - Pre-installation check (optional)
   - Mid-build documentation review
   - Final inspection and engineering sign-off

4. **VASS Engineering Certificate**
   - Issued upon successful inspection
   - Required for registration with VicRoads (or equivalent)

## Safety Procedures Followed

All high-voltage (HV) work has been conducted in line with industry-recognised safety protocols, including training completed through EV Allianceâ€™s High Voltage Safety course. Key practices include:

- Personal protective equipment (PPE): fire-resistant clothing, HV gloves, safety footwear, and eye protection
- Workshop safety: signage, barrier tape, induction, and restricted access
- HV isolation procedures: 12V disconnection, service plugs, tag-out systems
- No live work performed without qualified supervision
- Proper jacking technique and vehicle support

For detailed procedures, refer to:
- [Stage 5: Battery Installation](build/stage5_battery.md)
- [Stage 6: Electrical Integration](build/stage6_electrical.md)

## Next Steps

- Finalise battery and electrical diagrams for submission.
- Record key installation measurements and torque specs.
- Prepare weight report (corner weights, distribution).
- Confirm vehicle brake and suspension system condition.
- Book pre-inspection walk-through with VASS engineer.

---

## Notes for Certification Submission

- All modifications must be clearly documented, photographed, and traceable.
- Ensure all wiring and HV enclosures are permanently labelled.
- Include part receipts or spec sheets for major components.
- Provide printed wiring diagrams and safety rationale at time of inspection.
- Consider submitting a logbook of work completed to date.

---

## Outcome

Achieving VASS certification will confirm that the converted Mini EV meets all legal, safety, and performance criteria for registration as a roadworthy electric vehicle in Victoria, Australia.
