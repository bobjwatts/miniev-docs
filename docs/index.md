# Mini EV Conversion Project 

![Mini and Leaf](media/miniandmotor.png)  

Test Welcome to the documentation of the 2006 Mini Cooper S electric vehicle project, utilizing components from a Gen 2 Nissan Leaf. This site serves as my primary guide during the conversion, providing structured procedures, references, and safety guidelines.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a practical, safe, and compliant daily driver by carefully integrating Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) components into a compact, sporty Mini Cooper chassis.

### Vehicle Details:

- **Base Vehicle:** 2006 Mini Cooper S (R53)
- **Donor Vehicle:** Nissan Leaf (Gen 2, 2018 onwards)
- **Planned Budget:** Approximately $18,000 AUD (minus $8000 with the sale of our second car)
- **Projected Timeline:** Approximately 12 months

## Purpose of Documentation

- **Personal Reference:** To maintain organized, step-by-step instructions throughout the conversion.
- **Compliance & Safety:** Clearly demonstrate adherence to Australian Conversion Certification (ACC) guidelines and industry-standard high-voltage safety procedures.
- **Professional Collaboration:** Provide clear and credible information for the Vehicle Assessment Signatory Scheme (VASS) engineer overseeing certification.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Serve as a practical resource for other EV conversion enthusiasts.

## Commitment to Safety

Due to the inherent risks associated with working on high-voltage systems (including electrocution, thermal runaway, and fire), all project activities strictly adhere to industry-standard safety protocols. The following core safety practices are consistently applied throughout the project:

- The team have completed the Certified in EV High Voltage Safety, EV Alliance 
- Comprehensive Job Safety Analysis (JSA) before commencing each stage.
- Adherence to vehicle manufacturer recommendations and procedures.
- Proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage, including HV-rated gloves, safety footwear, and fire-resistant clothing.
- Safe isolation procedures for high-voltage systems.
- Clearly marked and restricted work areas, utilizing appropriate safety signage and barrier methods.
- Regular use of diagnostic and insulated tools meeting applicable Australian standards.
- Continuous safety verification using vehicle-specific service manuals and guidelines.

## Project Stages

The conversion project is structured in sequential stages for clarity, safety, and compliance:

1. **Logging and Identifying Mini Cooper CAN Bus Signals**
2. **Nissan Leaf Bench Testing and Component Validation**
3. **Vehicle Disassembly and Preparation**
4. **Mechanical Integration (Motor, Gearbox, Drivetrain)**
5. **Battery Installation and Safety Integration**
6. **Electrical System Integration**
7. **CAN Bus Spoofing and System Integration**
8. **Climate Control and Interior Systems Refinement**
9. **ACC Certification and Compliance Verification**

Detailed procedures, diagrams, safety notes, and reference materials will be provided within each stage.
