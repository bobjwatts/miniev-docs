## Procedure: Mechanical Integration

Complete the integration following these structured steps:

### Step 1: Component Measurement and Test Fit
- Measure and document critical dimensions of Nissan Leaf drivetrain.
- Conduct a preliminary test fit within Mini Cooper engine bay.
- Confirm clearances for hood, firewall, steering, and suspension components.

### Step 2: Fabrication of Motor and Gearbox Mounts
- Design and fabricate custom mounts to securely position motor and gearbox assembly.
- Use suitable materials (e.g., steel plate, aluminum alloy) to withstand torque and vibration.
- Verify structural integrity of fabricated components through stress analysis if possible.

### Step 3: Motor and Gearbox Installation
- Carefully lift and position Leaf drivetrain components into place using suitable lifting equipment.
- Secure drivetrain assembly onto fabricated mounts with appropriate fasteners and hardware.
- Ensure correct torque settings and locking mechanisms per manufacturer guidelines.

### Step 4: Driveshaft and CV Joint Integration
- Adapt Nissan Leaf output shafts to Mini Cooper driveshafts and CV joints.
- Use custom couplings or machine adapters as required, ensuring alignment and balance.
- Confirm clearances through full suspension and steering articulation range.

### Step 5: Alignment and Verification
- Perform detailed alignment checks (laser alignment recommended).
- Verify correct axial alignment of motor, gearbox, and driveshafts to reduce vibration and wear.
- Adjust mounts or coupling components if alignment corrections are necessary.

### Step 6: Cooling System Mechanical Setup
- Install Leaf drivetrain cooling components (radiator, coolant hoses, pumps).
- Mount securely, ensuring protection from mechanical damage and adequate airflow.
- Verify clearances around suspension and chassis components.

### Step 7: Ancillary Component Mounting
- Mount Nissan Leaf charger, DC-DC converter, and related components securely in the chassis.
- Consider accessibility and future maintenance requirements in placement.
