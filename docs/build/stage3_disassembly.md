# Stage 3: Mini Cooper Disassembly

This stage covers the systematic removal of the internal combustion engine (ICE) components from the 2005 Mini Cooper S, preparing it for integration of the Nissan Leaf EV components.

---

## Objectives

- Safely remove the internal combustion engine, gearbox, fuel system, and related ICE components.
- Preserve vehicle integrity, minimizing damage to chassis, interior, and reusable components.
- Prepare the vehicle chassis and systems for subsequent EV drivetrain integration.

---

## Equipment Required

### Tools and Equipment:
- Standard automotive hand tools (sockets, wrenches, screwdrivers, etc.)
- Engine hoist and stands
- Vehicle lift or professional jack stands
- Fluid catch trays for oil, coolant, fuel
- Diagnostic tools (OBD-II scan tool)
- Electrical labelling equipment

### Safety Equipment:
- PPE including safety glasses, gloves, and safety footwear
- Spill containment materials for fluids
- Workshop safety signage and barriers
- Insulated tools for battery and electrical component removal

---

## Pre-Disassembly Safety Steps

- Perform Job Safety Analysis (JSA) specific to vehicle disassembly.
- Review Mini Cooper service manual procedures.
- Clearly mark workspace, restrict access, and display safety signage.
- Designate a responsible person to monitor workshop safety throughout the process.
- Ensure all fire extinguishing equipment is nearby and clearly labelled.

## Procedure: Vehicle Disassembly

Follow these structured steps to safely disassemble the Mini Cooper:

### Step 1: Preparation and Documentation
- Photograph and document the initial condition of the vehicle.
- Label and document wiring harnesses, connectors, hoses, and removable components.

### Step 2: Disconnect 12V Battery and Electrical Systems
- Safely disconnect the vehicleâ€™s 12V battery negative terminal first.
- Isolate and secure battery cables away from accidental reconnection.
- Remove and store the battery safely.

### Step 3: Drain and Remove Fluids
- Drain coolant, engine oil, gearbox oil, brake fluid (if necessary), and fuel.
- Properly dispose of fluids according to local environmental regulations.

### Step 4: Remove Front-end Components
- Carefully remove bonnet, front bumper, radiator, and intercooler assemblies.
- Label all hardware clearly to aid future reassembly or resale.

### Step 5: Engine and Gearbox Removal
- Disconnect all ancillary components connected to the engine (exhaust, air intake, wiring, fuel lines, coolant hoses).
- Secure engine and gearbox with appropriate lifting gear.
- Unbolt engine and gearbox mounts and remove carefully, ensuring no damage to chassis components.

### Step 6: Fuel System Removal
- Safely remove fuel tank, fuel pump, and associated fuel lines.
- Ensure fuel components are stored in a ventilated, flame-free area.

### Step 7: Exhaust and Emissions Systems
- Remove exhaust system components, catalytic converters, and oxygen sensors.
- Store components securely if planning resale or recycling.

### Step 8: Ancillary ICE Component Removal
- Remove additional ICE-specific items (starter motor, alternator, belts, pulleys).
- Clearly label removed components for reuse or resale.

### Step 9: Interior and Dashboard Preparations
- Carefully remove interior panels and dashboard sections necessary for later integration.
- Document and label wiring harnesses and connectors for clarity during EV integration.

### Step 10: Chassis and Suspension Assessment
- Inspect and document chassis and suspension condition.
- Identify and address any rust, corrosion, or mechanical issues before EV component installation.

## Safety and Cleanup After Disassembly

- Thoroughly inspect the disassembled vehicle for loose parts or hazards.
- Clearly label and store all reusable or saleable components.
- Dispose of non-reusable parts and fluids following environmental guidelines.
- Clean and organize workspace in preparation for next project stages.

---

## Outcomes and Next Steps

Successful completion of vehicle disassembly prepares the Mini Cooper chassis for the next phases of mechanical integration and EV system installation.

**Follow-up actions:**

- Update project documentation with detailed images, diagrams, and notes.
- List and sell surplus ICE components to offset project costs.
- Address any identified chassis or structural issues prior to EV component integration.
