# Stage 8: Climate Control & Interior Refinement

This stage covers the installation of an aftermarket all-in-one electric HVAC unit (providing both cabin heating and cooling), along with final interior wiring and refinements. The goal is to ensure comfort, function, and a clean, professional finish while supporting EV operation.

---

## Objectives

- Install and wire a self-contained electric HVAC unit for cabin temperature control.
- Integrate the new HVAC system cleanly into the Mini’s cabin.
- Tidy and finalize any remaining interior work related to the EV swap.
- Retain or update original gauges and controls as required.

## HVAC System: Overview

The selected HVAC unit is an all-in-one 12V electric heater/cooler with onboard blower and digital control panel:

**Product Example:**  
[12V Electric Air Conditioner & Heater Kit – eBay AU (296811991654)](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/296811991654)

- **Features:**
  - Combined heating and cooling from a single unit
  - Standalone controls (manual or digital panel)
  - Integrated blower motor and fan speed control
  - Separate power inputs for compressor and heater (typically fused 12V)
  - Optional ducting to connect to factory vents

---

## Equipment Required

### HVAC System:
- Aftermarket A/C-heater unit with digital controller
- Ducting and vent adapters (if reusing Mini vents)
- Insulated heater wiring
- Appropriately sized fuses and relays
- Mounting brackets or isolation pads

### Tools:
- Trim tools and cutting tools for ducting
- Multimeter for voltage checks
- Heat shrink, connectors, and crimpers
- Drill and rivet tools (for bracket fabrication)

---

## Pre-Installation Safety

- Isolate 12V battery before wiring HVAC.
- Ensure wiring is fused and routed away from sharp edges or high-temp areas.
- Mark interior workspace and restrict access during install.
- Check manufacturer specifications for current draw on each mode (heat/cool).

---

## Procedure: HVAC System Installation

### Step 1: Mounting the Unit
- Identify mounting location behind or below the dash (passenger side preferred).
- Fabricate brackets or supports to secure the unit without rattles or stress on plastic housing.
- Use rubber isolation pads if mounting directly to metal for noise/vibration dampening.

### Step 2: Wiring and Power Supply
- Wire main power feeds (heater and A/C compressor lines) through an ignition-switched relay.
- Include appropriate fuses near battery or fuse box.
- Connect blower and control panel wiring according to included manual.
- Route wiring cleanly using split conduit and heat-resistant loom.

### Step 3: Ducting and Airflow
- Optionally connect the unit’s outlets to the Mini’s original vent system using duct adapters.
- Secure ducts to avoid disconnection during driving.
- Test airflow direction and strength on each fan speed.

### Step 4: System Test
- Reconnect 12V battery and ignition circuit.
- Run system in heating and cooling modes.
- Monitor current draw and ensure fuses do not blow under load.
- Validate functionality of temperature control, blower speed, and mode switching.

## Procedure: Interior Finishing Touches

### Step 5: EV Display or Gauge Integration (Optional)
- Mount a small display (e.g. OLED or LCD screen) to show:
  - Battery SOC
  - HV system voltage
  - Orion BMS alerts or temperature readings

### Step 6: Trim and Panel Reassembly
- Refit any removed dash or trim panels from earlier stages.
- Confirm correct operation of all switches, hazard lights, stalks, and internal lighting.
- Tidy wiring behind dash and under seats using proper anchor points.

## Outcomes and Next Steps

After completing this stage, the vehicle will have a functional climate control system suitable for daily use, and the interior will be restored to a clean, roadworthy condition.

**Follow-up actions:**

- Document fuse ratings, wiring diagrams, and current draw for VASS compliance.
- Test HVAC unit under different ambient conditions (summer/winter).
- Proceed to Stage 9: Certification & Road Approval.
