# Stage 5: Battery Pack Installation

This stage covers the safe and compliant installation of Nissan Leaf battery modules into custom-designed battery boxes within the Mini Cooper chassis, including integration with the Orion Battery Management System (BMS).

---

## Objectives

- Safely install Nissan Leaf battery modules within the Mini Cooper.
- Design and construct secure, insulated, and compliant battery boxes.
- Integrate the Orion BMS for accurate battery monitoring and management.
- Ensure compliance with high-voltage (HV) safety guidelines and ACC certification requirements.

## Equipment Required

### EV Components:
- Nissan Leaf Gen 2 battery modules
- Orion Battery Management System (BMS)
- HV cabling, connectors, and contactors
- Appropriate fuses, isolators, and emergency disconnects

### Workshop Tools:
- Fabrication equipment for battery boxes (welder, metal-cutting tools)
- Insulation and sealing materials for HV safety
- Electrical tools (crimpers, HV-rated connectors, cable cutters, torque wrench)
- Multimeter and HV diagnostic tools for testing

### Safety Equipment:
- PPE including HV-rated gloves, safety glasses, insulated footwear
- Fire-resistant clothing or overalls
- Clear HV safety signage, barriers, and lock-out/tag-out systems
- Class D fire extinguishing equipment specifically rated for battery fires

## Pre-Installation Safety Steps

- Conduct a detailed Job Safety Analysis (JSA).
- Clearly mark HV working areas with safety signage and restrict access.
- Ensure availability of suitable fire extinguishing equipment.
- Assign a responsible person to supervise safety during installation.
- Review relevant manufacturer and Orion BMS documentation before proceeding.

## Procedure: Battery Pack Installation

### Step 1: Battery Module Inspection
- Carefully inspect each Nissan Leaf battery module for damage or issues.
- Record voltage and condition of each module individually using Orion BMS or appropriate HV-rated multimeter.

### Step 2: Battery Box Design and Fabrication
- Design battery boxes to fit securely within the Mini Cooper chassis, ensuring mechanical strength and protection.
- Use fire-resistant, non-conductive materials or suitable metal enclosures insulated to HV standards.
- Ensure battery boxes provide adequate ventilation, cooling, and secure module fixation points.

### Step 3: Battery Module Installation
- Position and securely fix battery modules within fabricated battery boxes.
- Verify each module is insulated and mechanically secure, eliminating movement or vibration during vehicle operation.
- Ensure no risk of short-circuits, mechanical abrasion, or damage to battery cells.

### Step 4: Orion BMS Integration
- Wire each battery module individually to the Orion BMS, adhering strictly to Orionâ€™s wiring guidelines.
- Verify proper cell balancing, voltage monitoring, and thermal management connections.
- Configure Orion BMS software settings for your battery module configuration.

### Step 5: HV Cabling and Safety Systems
- Install HV cables, ensuring insulation and secure routing through vehicle chassis.
- Install appropriate fuses, contactors, and isolators in accessible yet secure locations.
- Include clearly marked emergency HV disconnect accessible from outside the vehicle for safety compliance.

### Step 6: Initial System Checks
- Conduct preliminary voltage and continuity checks using HV diagnostic tools.
- Power on the Orion BMS to confirm battery cell voltage monitoring and thermal management functionality.
- Confirm HV isolation and no faults detected via diagnostic tests.

## Safety and Cleanup After Installation

- Securely isolate and lock out HV battery pack when unattended.
- Remove all tools, spare components, and debris from workspace.
- Label all HV components clearly and permanently.
- Document all installation steps, wiring diagrams, and test results thoroughly.

## Outcomes and Next Steps

Successful battery pack installation, including BMS integration, ensures vehicle safety, system reliability, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Follow-up actions:**

- Regularly monitor battery health via Orion BMS during subsequent stages.
- Prepare detailed documentation for ACC engineer review.
- Move forward to Stage 6: Electrical System Integration and further wiring refinement.
